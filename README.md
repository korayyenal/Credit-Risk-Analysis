# Credit Risk Analysis
This is a course-work independent project I worked on in MSc Fall 2021 semester.

## Aim 
The purpose of this project is learn, compare,  and evaluate different supervised learning models on credit application data.

## Models Covered
1. Logistic Regression
2. XGBoost
3. Adaboost
4. Blackboost

## Variable Selection and Tuning
The logistic regression model variables are selected using lasso l-1 regularization.

I have added a RMarkdown file. I hope it will help in better explaining the whole code-base.
